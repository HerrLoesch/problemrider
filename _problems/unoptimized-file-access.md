## Description
Unoptimized file access refers to inefficient methods of reading from or writing to the filesystem, leading to performance bottlenecks. This can manifest as reading a large file into memory when only a small part is needed, making numerous small read/write calls instead of fewer larger ones, or not using appropriate buffering techniques. These inefficiencies can significantly slow down an application, especially when dealing with large files or a high volume of file operations. Optimizing file access is crucial for applications that are I/O-bound.

## Indicators ⟡
- The application is slow when reading or writing files.
- The application is using a lot of disk I/O.
- The application is using a lot of CPU when reading or writing files.
- The application is unresponsive when reading or writing files.

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Excessive Disk I/O](excessive-disk-io.md):** System monitoring shows a high number of read/write operations per second on disk, even for seemingly simple file operations.
- **Slow File Operations:** Reading from or writing to files takes an unusually long time.
- **Application Lag/Unresponsiveness:** The application becomes sluggish or freezes when performing file-related tasks.
- **Increased CPU Usage:** The CPU may be busy with I/O wait states or processing many small I/O requests.
- **Disk Activity Spikes:** The disk activity lights or metrics show constant, heavy usage.

## Root Causes ▼

- **Reading/Writing Character by Character:** Instead of reading or writing in larger blocks or buffers, the application performs many small, individual I/O operations.
- **Frequent File Opening/Closing:** Files are opened and closed repeatedly within a loop, incurring overhead for each operation.
- **Unnecessary File Scans:** The application scans entire files or directories when only a small portion of data is needed.
- **Synchronous I/O in Performance-Critical Paths:** Performing blocking file I/O operations on the main thread or in a critical path, causing the application to wait.
- **Lack of Buffering:** Data is written directly to disk without being buffered in memory, leading to many small, inefficient writes.
- **Incorrect File Access Modes:** Using a file access mode that is less efficient than required (e.g., opening for read/write when only read is needed).

## Detection Methods ○

- **System Monitoring Tools:** Use `iostat`, `vmstat`, `sar` (Linux) or Performance Monitor (Windows) to track disk I/O metrics and identify processes with high I/O.
- **Application Profiling:** Use profilers to identify code sections that spend a lot of time in file I/O operations.
- **Code Review:** Look for loops that perform file operations, or patterns of frequent file opening/closing.
- **Benchmarking:** Measure the performance of file-related operations with different access patterns.

## Examples
A log analysis tool processes large log files. Instead of reading the file line by line using a buffered reader, it reads each character individually. This results in millions of tiny disk reads, making the process extremely slow and consuming excessive CPU due to context switching. In another case, a configuration management system updates a configuration file by reading the entire file, modifying a single line, and then writing the entire file back to disk for every small change. This leads to high disk I/O and contention when many small configuration updates occur. This problem is common in applications that handle large amounts of data or perform frequent file operations. It often arises from a lack of awareness of efficient I/O patterns or from porting code written for different environments without optimization.

Go through each problem file and inspect the **Symptoms** and **Root Cause** sections. For each entry, review the titles mentioned in those sections and determine whether they refer to other existing problem files. If a match is found, create a relative Markdown link to the corresponding problem description. This will help build connections between related problems and reduce duplication in the future.

Do not create a script for this task. Use the capabilities and tools you have at hand. A purely tool-based approach will not work in all cases, as some titles may have slight wording differences. In such cases, rename the titles—and adjust them to be linkable and meaningful—but keep the file names as they are.

If you find problems that are not mentioned in the **Symptoms** or **Root Cause** sections but should be linked, add those links in the appropriate sections.

Also revisit existing links to check for broken ones and fix them where possible.

If you encounter a “lack of <something>” link pointing to a non-existent file, remove it. These files have been deleted. Do not remove other non-existent problem links—leave them in place, as they may be added later.

Choose a random file to start with. Do not rename files—only rename titles to better match their file names.

## Description
Inefficient code is a broad problem that can have a wide range of causes, from the use of inefficient algorithms and data structures to a lack of proper optimization. It is characterized by code that is slow, consumes a large amount of resources, or is generally difficult to maintain. Writing efficient code requires a deep understanding of the language and the platform, as well as a commitment to performance and quality. It is an essential skill for any software developer.

## Indicators ⟡
- The application is slow, even on a powerful machine.
- The application is using a lot of CPU or memory.
- The application is not scalable.
- The code is difficult to understand and maintain.

## Symptoms ▲

- **High CPU Utilization:** The application process consumes a large amount of CPU, even under moderate load.
- **Slow Response Times:** The application is slow to respond to requests, even when there are no external dependencies.
- **[Memory Leaks](memory-leaks.md):** The application's memory usage grows over time, eventually leading to a crash.
- **Reduced Throughput:** The application can handle fewer requests per second than expected.
- **Difficulty Scaling:** Adding more servers does not improve performance as much as expected.
- **[High Resource Utilization on Client](high-resource-utilization-on-client.md):** Inefficient client-side code can lead to excessive resource consumption on the user's device.

## Root Causes ▼

- **Algorithmic Complexity:** The code uses an inefficient algorithm (e.g., a nested loop where a single loop would suffice).
- **Unoptimized Data Structures:** The code uses a data structure that is not well-suited for the task at hand (e.g., a list instead of a hash map for lookups).
- **Excessive Object Allocation:** The code creates a large number of temporary objects, which puts pressure on the garbage collector.
- **Blocking I/O:** The code performs I/O operations in a blocking manner, which prevents the application from handling other requests while waiting for the I/O to complete.
- **Inefficient Library Usage:** The code uses a library in a way that is known to be slow.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Profilers:** Use a profiler to analyze the application's CPU and memory usage and identify the exact lines of code that are causing the bottleneck.
- **Code Review:** Carefully review the code to look for common performance anti-patterns.
- **Benchmarking:** Write benchmarks to measure the performance of specific parts of the code and track performance over time.
- **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to automatically detect potential performance issues in the code.

## Examples
A social media application has a feature that displays a user's timeline. The timeline is generated by a function that iterates over all of the user's friends and then iterates over all of their posts to find the most recent ones. This nested loop is very inefficient and causes the timeline to load slowly for users with a large number of friends. In another case, a data processing application reads a large file into memory and then processes it line by line. This is inefficient because it consumes a large amount of memory. A better approach would be to process the file line by line without reading the entire file into memory first. This is a common problem in applications that have been developed over a long period of time by many different developers. Over time, the codebase can become complex and difficult to understand, which makes it easy to introduce performance bottlenecks.

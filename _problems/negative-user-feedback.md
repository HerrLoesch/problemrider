## Description
Negative user feedback is a clear signal that an application is not meeting the needs or expectations of its users. This feedback can come in many forms, from bad reviews and support tickets to social media complaints and declining usage. While it can be difficult to hear, negative feedback is also a valuable source of information that can be used to improve the product. Ignoring or dismissing negative feedback is a sure way to lose users and damage a brand's reputation.

## Indicators ⟡
- A decline in new user sign-ups.
- An increase in negative reviews on social media or app stores.
- A drop in the number of active users.
- A decrease in the average time users spend in the application.

## Symptoms ▲

- **Direct Complaints:** Users explicitly state their dissatisfaction through support tickets, app store reviews, social media, or direct communication.
- **Low Ratings/Reviews:** Decreased ratings on app stores or review platforms.
- **[Declining Business Metrics](declining-business-metrics.md):** Users stop using the application.
- **Reduced Engagement:** Users interact less with the application or specific features.
- **High Bounce Rate:** For web applications, users leave the site quickly after arriving.
- **Verbal Feedback:** Anecdotal evidence from sales, marketing, or customer support teams about user frustration.

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Slow Application Performance](slow-application-performance.md):** The application is sluggish, unresponsive, or has long loading times.
- **[High Defect Rate in Production](high-defect-rate-in-production.md):** Frequent bugs and crashes frustrate users.
- **[Poor User Experience (UX) Design](poor-user-experience-ux-design.md):** The application is difficult to navigate, confusing, or not intuitive.
- **Missing or Inadequate Features:** The application does not meet user needs or expectations.

- **Lack of Accessibility:** The application is not usable by individuals with disabilities.
- **[Inadequate Onboarding](inadequate-onboarding.md):** New users struggle to understand how to use the application.

## Detection Methods ○

- **User Feedback Channels:** Actively monitor and analyze support tickets, app store reviews, social media mentions, and direct feedback forms.
- **User Surveys:** Conduct surveys to gather quantitative and qualitative feedback on user satisfaction.
- **Usability Testing:** Observe users interacting with the application to identify pain points and areas of confusion.
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** Measure user loyalty and satisfaction through NPS surveys.
- **Session Replay Tools:** Record and replay user sessions to understand their interactions and frustrations.
- **A/B Testing:** Test different UI/UX designs or features to see which performs better in terms of user satisfaction.

## Examples
An update to a popular mobile game introduces a new, complex inventory management system. Players flood the app store with 1-star reviews, complaining about the difficulty of managing items, leading to a significant drop in daily active users. In another case, a banking application receives numerous support calls from elderly users who are unable to find the bill payment option due to a recent UI redesign that moved the feature to a less intuitive location. Negative user feedback is a direct indicator of problems that impact the end-user. Addressing these issues is crucial for user retention, brand reputation, and ultimately, business success.

## Description

Scope expansion occurs when project requirements grow significantly beyond the original definition during the development process, often without corresponding adjustments to timeline, budget, or resource allocation. This expansion can result from evolving business needs, stakeholder requests, discovered complexity, or poor initial requirement definition. Unlike controlled scope changes, scope expansion happens gradually and often without formal recognition or planning adjustments.

## Indicators ⟡

- Original project requirements are significantly different from final deliverables
- Development teams work on features that weren't in the original specification
- Project timelines stretch far beyond original estimates without formal scope change processes
- Stakeholders continuously add "small" requests that accumulate into major changes
- Feature sets grow organically throughout development without impact assessment

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Missed Deadlines](missed-deadlines.md):** Original timelines become impossible due to expanded requirements
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Teams feel pressure to deliver expanded scope within original timeframes
- **Resource Strain:** Development capacity is exceeded by the actual scope of work required
- **Quality Compromises:** Expanded scope leads to shortcuts to meet original deadlines
- **Team Frustration:** Developers feel overwhelmed by constantly changing and growing requirements

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Scope Creep](scope-creep.md):** Gradual, uncontrolled expansion of project requirements
- **Poor Change Control:** No formal process for evaluating and approving scope changes
- **Stakeholder Management Issues:** Inability to say no to additional requests from business stakeholders
- **Underestimated Complexity:** Original scope didn't account for actual system complexity
- **Evolving Business Needs:** Business requirements change during development without process adjustments
- **Gold Plating:** Developers add features beyond requirements without proper approval

## Detection Methods ○

- **Scope Change Tracking:** Monitor additions and modifications to original project requirements
- **Timeline vs. Scope Analysis:** Compare original scope and timeline with actual deliverables and duration
- **Feature Request Analysis:** Track informal feature requests and their impact on project scope
- **Effort Variance Tracking:** Monitor actual effort compared to original estimates
- **Stakeholder Request Patterns:** Analyze frequency and nature of additional requests from stakeholders

## Examples

A customer portal project originally scoped for basic account viewing and password reset grows to include advanced reporting, document upload, payment processing, and mobile optimization when stakeholders see early prototypes and request additional functionality. The original 3-month timeline becomes 8 months, but the deadline pressure remains because the launch was tied to a marketing campaign. Another example involves an internal tool project where the initial requirement for simple data entry expands to include workflow management, approval processes, integration with five external systems, and custom reporting when different departments see the potential and request their own features to be included.

## Description
Excessive disk I/O can be a major cause of poor application performance. This can be caused by a variety of factors, from inefficient file access patterns and a lack of proper caching to a high volume of logging. When an application is I/O-bound, it can lead to a degradation in performance, timeouts, and even a complete failure of the system. A systematic approach to performance analysis is required to identify and address the root causes of excessive disk I/O.

## Indicators ⟡
- The disk activity light on your server is constantly blinking.
- The server's cooling fans are running at high speed, even when the CPU load is low.
- You see a high number of I/O operations in your system monitoring tools.
- Your application is slow, even though the CPU and memory usage are low.

## Symptoms ▲

- **High I/O Wait Times:** System monitoring shows a significant percentage of CPU time spent waiting for disk I/O operations to complete.
- **Slow Application Performance:** Applications that rely heavily on disk access become sluggish and unresponsive.
- **Disk Activity Spikes:** The disk activity lights or metrics show constant, heavy usage, even when the overall system load seems moderate.
- **Increased Latency for Disk-Bound Operations:** Operations like file reads/writes, database queries, or log writes take an unusually long time.
- **Premature Disk Wear:** For physical disks, excessive I/O can lead to faster degradation.

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Inefficient Database Indexing](inefficient-database-indexing.md):** Lack of proper indexes forces full table scans, leading to large amounts of data being read from disk.
- **[Memory Swapping](memory-swapping.md):** The system is running out of RAM and is constantly moving data between RAM and disk (swapping).
- **[Unoptimized File Access](unoptimized-file-access.md):** Applications are reading or writing files inefficiently (e.g., reading character by character instead of in blocks, frequent small writes).
- **[Excessive Logging](excessive-logging.md):** Applications are generating a very high volume of logs, constantly writing to disk.
- **Large Data Processing:** Batch jobs or data analytics tasks are processing very large datasets that exceed available memory, forcing frequent disk access.
- **Disk Contention:** Multiple applications or processes are simultaneously trying to access the same disk resources.

## Detection Methods ○

- **System Monitoring Tools:** Use tools like `iostat`, `vmstat`, `sar` (Linux) or Performance Monitor (Windows) to track disk I/O metrics (e.g., read/write operations per second, average queue length, I/O wait time).
- **Database Monitoring Tools:** Database-specific tools often provide metrics on disk I/O related to database operations.
- **Application Profiling:** Profile the application to identify code sections that are performing excessive disk operations.
- **Log Analysis:** Analyze log volumes and patterns to see if excessive logging is occurring.

## Examples
A data processing service is designed to read large CSV files, process them, and write the results to another file. During execution, the server's disk I/O goes to 100%, and the process takes hours. Investigation reveals that the service is reading and writing data one line at a time, causing thousands of small, inefficient disk operations. Similarly, a web server experiencing slow page loads might have high disk I/O, even with a separate database server, if it's constantly writing session data to local disk files for every request instead of using an in-memory cache.

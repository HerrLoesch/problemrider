## Description
Slow application performance is a broad problem that can have a wide range of causes, from inefficient code to network latency. It is characterized by an application that is unresponsive, takes a long time to load, or is generally sluggish in its operation. This can lead to a poor user experience, decreased productivity, and ultimately, a loss of users. A systematic approach to performance analysis is required to identify and address the root causes of a slow application.

## Indicators ⟡
- Your application is slow, but your servers are not under heavy load.
- You are getting complaints from users about slow performance.
- Your application is not as responsive as it used to be.
- Your application is using a lot of CPU or memory.

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Negative User Feedback](negative-user-feedback.md):** Users complain about slow loading times or application freezes.
- **[High Resource Utilization on Client](high-resource-utilization-on-client.md):** Client applications may consume more CPU or memory while waiting for API responses.
- **[Task Queues Backing Up](task-queues-backing-up.md):** Asynchronous jobs that depend on the API take longer to process, causing queues to grow.
- **[Increased Error Rates](increased-error-rates.md):** Slowness can lead to secondary errors, like timeouts or resource exhaustion, which manifest as increased error rates in monitoring tools.
- **[Declining Business Metrics](declining-business-metrics.md):** Metrics like user engagement, conversion rates, or task completion rates decline as users abandon the slow application.

## Root Causes ▼

- **[High API Latency](high-api-latency.md):** The application relies on an API that is slow to respond.
- **[Inefficient Frontend Code](inefficient-frontend-code.md):** The user interface itself is slow due to unoptimized code, large asset sizes, or excessive rendering.
- **[Network Latency](network-latency.md):** High latency between the user's device and the application servers.
- **[Slow Database Queries](slow-database-queries.md):** The application triggers inefficient database operations.
- **[Resource Contention](resource-contention.md):** The application server is overloaded and competing for limited resources.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Real User Monitoring (RUM):** Use RUM tools to measure the actual performance experienced by users.
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Use APM tools to trace requests and identify bottlenecks.
- **User Feedback:** Actively collect and analyze user feedback.
- **Browser Developer Tools:** Use the performance and network tabs in browser developer tools to analyze frontend performance.

## Examples
An e-commerce site's product pages take a long time to load, especially on mobile devices. Analysis with RUM tools shows that the page is downloading a large, unoptimized image for each product. In another case, a single-page application (SPA) feels sluggish when navigating between different views. The browser's developer tools reveal that the application is re-rendering the entire page on every navigation, instead of just the parts that have changed. This is a common problem for applications that have grown over time without a focus on performance. As new features are added, the application becomes more complex and slower, until it reaches a tipping point where the performance is unacceptable to users.

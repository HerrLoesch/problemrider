## Description

Difficulty onboarding new hires occurs when new team members take much longer than expected to understand the system, learn development workflows, and begin contributing effectively. This problem often indicates underlying issues with code complexity, documentation quality, knowledge management, or system architecture that make it challenging for newcomers to become productive quickly.

## Indicators ⟡

- New developers take months rather than weeks to make meaningful contributions
- Onboarding timelines consistently exceed estimates
- New team members express confusion about system architecture or business logic
- Experienced team members spend significant time mentoring new hires on basic system concepts
- New developers avoid working on certain parts of the system for extended periods

## Symptoms ▲

- **Extended Learning Curve:** New team members require much longer to understand the system than anticipated
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Critical information isn't accessible to new team members
- **Reduced Team Capacity:** Experienced developers spend time on mentoring rather than development work
- **New Hire Frustration:** Team members become frustrated with slow progress in understanding the system
- **Higher Turnover Risk:** New employees may leave if they struggle to become productive

## Root Causes ▼

- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Complex, convoluted codebase is difficult for newcomers to understand
- **[Complex and Obscure Logic](complex-and-obscure-logic.md):** Business logic is implemented in ways that are hard to follow
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Critical system knowledge exists only in the heads of long-term team members
- **Information Decay:** System architecture, business rules, and development processes aren't well documented
- **[Inconsistent Codebase](inconsistent-codebase.md):** Different parts of the system follow different conventions and patterns
- **[Legacy Code Without Tests](legacy-code-without-tests.md):** Lack of tests makes it difficult to understand what code is supposed to do

## Detection Methods ○

- **Onboarding Time Tracking:** Monitor how long new team members take to become fully productive
- **New Hire Surveys:** Regularly ask new team members about onboarding challenges and barriers
- **Mentoring Time Analysis:** Track how much time experienced developers spend helping new team members
- **Contribution Timeline Analysis:** Measure time from hire date to first meaningful code contribution
- **Exit Interview Analysis:** Understand whether onboarding difficulties contribute to early departures

## Examples

A new senior developer with 8 years of experience joins a team maintaining a financial trading system. Despite their expertise, it takes 4 months before they can confidently modify core trading algorithms because the business logic is embedded in complex, undocumented code with non-obvious dependencies between different system components. The existing team spends 25% of their time explaining system intricacies rather than developing features. Another example involves a healthcare software company where new developers require 6 months to understand the regulatory compliance requirements that are implemented through scattered conditional logic throughout the codebase, with no central documentation explaining how HIPAA requirements translate to specific code patterns.
